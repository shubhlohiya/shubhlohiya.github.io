  description: In the domain of multilingual KGs, Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) or fact prediction adds valuable information for the Relation Alignment (RA) and Entity Alignment (EA) tasks, and vice versa. The AlignKGC framework aims to jointly learn KGC, EA and RA for efficient knowledge transfer across KGs.

  description: Entity Alignment (EA) plays a vital role in automatically integrating multiple knowledge bases. Has BERT-INT, which gives almost saturation results on DBP15K, solved the Entity Alignment problem? <br> This work demonstrates the inadequacy of BERT-INT for EA in the presence of  low-resource pairs or high entity multiplicity.
