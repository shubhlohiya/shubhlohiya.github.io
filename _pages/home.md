<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am an incoming student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I will be pursuing the Masters of Science in Computer Science degree with a Machine Learning specialization.

I previously completed my undergraduate studies at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) where I majored in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and completed dual minor degrees in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and the [Centre of Machine Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/).<br>

During my undergraduate studies, I was involved in research at [InfoLab, IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/) where I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors like [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) and [Prof. Abir De](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~abir/). I did my Undergraduate Thesis on Joint Completion and Alignment of Multilingual Knowledge Graphs with the guidance of [Prof. Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/).<br>

I intend to use this website to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
I am broadly interested in language technologies for bridging the interaction gap between humans and computers and applications of AI in Healthcare. More specifically, my research interests include [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), Graph Learning, and [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).
