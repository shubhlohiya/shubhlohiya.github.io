<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: large" > Hello there!</span>

I'm a senior undergraduate at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) majoring in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and pursuing dual minor degrees in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and the [Centre of Machine Intelligence and Data Science](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/). <br><br>
I intend to use this corner of the web to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.
